copy one existinng  logical configuration three times and rename all of its id,logical and physical id to -1,-2,-3
(to create three new logical configurations ).set parent_physical_ids to eqs -1,-2,-3

the indexVal will be manipulated to keep track of these negative ids using indexVals.txt(instead of passing through tomas indexation)


after doing this,the network is configured through indexVal to have descriptor of vlan_y_id=2000 (only for active elements)
