For service recognition of newly defined service type:
Parameter type should be added in invConf Service Type definition after service type is registered in logical configuration
(right click on the tree and set as service and then fallow below instructions)

Parameter type should be automatically populated from saving of the xsds or render xml with service key names and their
final type (But it does'nt).For every new type we need to manually add these keys and their type to parameter_type table
(There is a user interface designed to do this in invConf->Service Types->edit -> add to available parameters).

This can be enhanced if we modify Logical configuration module to add to parameter_type as soon as a new type is
introduced when defining a logical configuration type in the form of XSD and XML.
